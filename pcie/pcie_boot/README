This directory contains following files:
	1) saBootApp.c: Sample boot application for booting TI816X or TI814X
	PCIe Endpoint (EP)connected to a PCIe Root Complex (RC).
		- This application is meant to be executed on PCIe RC
		- Requires TI81XX PCIe Boot Driver loaded
		- Execute the application without any arguments for help

	2) saBootApp: ELF built for running on TI814X/TI816X RC.

	3) Makefile: For building the application. Set following in the file:
		- CC: Compiler executable. Ensure that PATH is set already. This
		  can be host compiler or cross compiler (e.g., TI816X compiler)
		  as per the RC being used.
		- KERNEL_DIR: Path to kernel source directory, This kernel must
		  be the same running on RC and have TI81XX PCIe EP Boot Driver
		  sources present.

	4) bootscript.txt: U-Bot boot script for EP boot. By default it uses
	RAMDISK for kernel filesystem and the bootargs are for TI816X EP. Ensure
	that the addresses used for kernel (as part of 'bootm' command) and
	RAMDISK are as used by boot application to load respective images on EP.
	This file can be modified for TI814X EP.

	5)boot.scr: Prebuilt boot script image from above bootscript.txt.

Building:
	1) saBootApp: Type "make" on Linux host machine.
	2) boot.scr: Ensure that TI816X U-Boot 'mkimage' is in path and type:
		"mkimage -A arm -O linux -T script -C none -n 'PCIe Boot Script'
		-d bootscript.txt boot.scr"
