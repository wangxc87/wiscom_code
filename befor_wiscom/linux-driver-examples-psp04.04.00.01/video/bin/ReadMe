This directory will contain executables for Sample Video driver applications
provided with the release package.

Copy all the files under this folder to target and run all the sample
applications one by one in order as listed by ls -al command.

Frame rate calculated in SaMmapLoopback application may not be the same
under heavy system load.  Memory copy is happening in between the
captured and displayed frame. So this might take long time under heavy
system load and frame rate displayed may fall.  In any case the screen
refresh rate will remain same under heavy load condition also
as same buffers will be displayed by the V4L2 display driver if the
applications is not able to queue new buffer before the last buffer is
displayed.

SaMmapDisplay is slight shaking on LCD.  The reason behind that is
between the Queing of the new buffer and Dqueing of the old buffer
application of filling of the new buffer and its not able to fill
the buffer at enough pace at which the buffer is getting refreshed.
So De-queue happens late than expected and same buffer is displayed
by driver if no new buffer is queueud before the last queued buffer
finishes displaying. Thats why image is slight shaky.

By default saFbdevRotationFlip will run properly on LCD.  If it
needs to be run on DVI with 480P then it should be run as
"./saFbdevRotationFlip 1".
